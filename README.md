Overview
---------
Inertial Antics is a 3D exploration puzzle game in which you play the role of a research guinea pig, trying to escape a lab full of genetically haunted objects. As a tiny, defenseless target, you need to be possessed by mutated objects in order to take advantage of their properties and navigate through adversities to reach the exit. 

Transforming into objects of various sizes and material not only gives the character different levels of inertia, thus challenging you to strategically control your movement, but also bestows special behaviors on the character to interact with environments from a non-human perspective.

With a limited number of resources, and the unique nature of each possessable object, this game requires the player to expand their imagination, visual perception, and understanding of physics to successfully rescue the guinea pig. We believe that the excitement and a sense of humor brought by the novel gameplay and entertaining interactions will present an engaging experience to keep the player on their toes.

This game is developed purely for PC platforms. The development process to take about 5 weeks with a talented team of 3 game developers working around the clock to ensure the best output for our loyal players.
